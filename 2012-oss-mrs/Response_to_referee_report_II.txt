Hunting the Parent of the Orphan Stream: Identifying Stream Members From Low Resolution Spectroscopy

Casey, A. R., Da Costa, G., Keller, S. C., & Maunder, E.


I have read the revised manuscript and I believe this paper is now ready for publication. My concerns have been suitably addressed and I believe this paper (and the candidate Orphan stream giant star list contained therein) will prove to be a very useful contribution to the field. 

Some minor remaining nits:

1) In the Introduction it is stated that the Orphan stream is a spatial overdensity of ~10%. I believe this is only true after substantial color cuts have been applied, or the stream would surely have been discovered many decades ago in photographic surveys.

Response: 
We have altered this sentence to read as 'The Orphan Stream has an extremely low spatial over-density, which makes it difficult to separate stream members from halo stars.'

2) In Section 4.2, ``the same candidate selection' would better be phrased ``the same candidate list'.

Response: 
Changed as requested.

3) In Section 5, second sentence, ``criteria' should be ``criterion' and there should be an ``of' before ``contamination'.

Response:
Corrected.
